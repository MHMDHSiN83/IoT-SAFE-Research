# IoT-SAFE Research

This repository contains research and study materials related to **IoT SAFE** and cryptographic concepts relevant to IoT security. The materials include presentations and notes covering core topics such as encryption, key management, and message authentication.

## Contents

* **IoT SAFE** — Overview and architecture of IoT SAFE, with a dedicated presentation.
* **AES** — Study of AES encryption and its applications in IoT systems.
* **Key Rotation** — Research on key rotation mechanisms and best practices for secure IoT communication.
* **MAC** — Notes on Message Authentication Codes (MAC) and their use in IoT security.
* **Generate String** — Techniques for generating secure strings for keys, nonces, and tokens in SIM.
* **Final / Summary** — Consolidated presentation summarizing all topics.

## Project Purpose

This repository was created as part of an internship research project to explore IoT security protocols, cryptographic primitives, and practical implementation considerations. The goal is to provide clear, well-documented research materials for reference and learning.

also I implement some of these algorightms and features in [this](https://github.com/MHMDHSiN83/JCardSim) repository.
## Usage

* This repository is **research-oriented** and does not contain executable code.
* Files are primarily **PowerPoint presentations** summarizing findings.
* Suitable for anyone interested in IoT security or cryptography, or for academic/reference purposes.
